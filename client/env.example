VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend.onrailway.app

# Notes:
# - In development, you can omit VITE_API_URL and the app will use Vite's proxy and `/api`.
# - In production (Vercel/Netlify/Static hosting), set VITE_API_URL to your backend origin (without trailing slash).
# - Example values:
#   Railway: https://your-service-name.up.railway.app
#   Vercel (if backend hosted elsewhere): https://api.yourdomain.com
