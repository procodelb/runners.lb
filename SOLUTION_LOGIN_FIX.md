# 🔥 PRO SOLUTION: Fix Login Issue

## 🚨 PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
The login is failing because **VITE_API_URL environment variable is not set in Vercel**.

## ✅ BACKEND STATUS: PERFECT
- ✅ Backend API is working: https://soufiam-erp-backend.onrender.com
- ✅ Login endpoint returns 200 OK
- ✅ CORS is configured correctly
- ✅ Database connection is working
- ✅ JWT tokens are being generated

## ❌ FRONTEND STATUS: MISSING ENV VAR
- ❌ VITE_API_URL is not set in Vercel
- ❌ Frontend can't find the backend URL
- ❌ Login requests fail silently

## 🔧 IMMEDIATE FIX

### Option 1: Vercel Dashboard (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find project: `runners-lb`
3. Go to: **Settings → Environment Variables**
4. Click: **Add New**
5. Set:
   - **Name**: `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://soufiam-erp-backend.onrender.com`
   - **Environment**: Production (and Preview)
6. Click: **Save**
7. Go to: **Deployments → Redeploy latest**

### Option 2: Vercel CLI
```bash
npx vercel env add VITE_API_URL production
# When prompted, enter: https://soufiam-erp-backend.onrender.com
```

## 🎯 VERIFICATION STEPS

After setting the environment variable:

1. **Redeploy Vercel** (automatic or manual)
2. **Test the login**:
   - Go to: https://runners-lb.vercel.app
   - Use: `soufian@gmail.com` / `Soufi@n123`
   - Should work immediately!

## 🚀 EXPECTED RESULT

Once VITE_API_URL is set:
- ✅ Frontend will connect to backend
- ✅ Login will work perfectly
- ✅ All features will be functional
- ✅ Real-time updates will work
- ✅ Dashboard will load with data

## 🔍 TECHNICAL DETAILS

**Current Issue**: Frontend HTML doesn't contain API URL
