# 🚀 Soufiam ERP System - FIXED & OPERATIONAL

## ✅ System Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL

Your ERP system has been successfully fixed and is now working perfectly! All authentication and API endpoints are functioning correctly.

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Authentication Flow Issues**
- **Problem**: Client was getting 401 Unauthorized errors on `/api/auth/me`
- **Root Cause**: API base URL configuration was inconsistent between development and production
- **Solution**: Fixed API base URL to always use the deployed backend URL

### 2. **API Endpoint 404 Errors**
- **Problem**: Multiple endpoints returning 404 errors (dashboard/stats, orders, transactions)
- **Root Cause**: Client was trying to access relative URLs that don't exist on the frontend domain
- **Solution**: Updated all API calls to use the full backend URL

### 3. **Client-Side Configuration**
- **Problem**: Vite proxy configuration was causing issues in production
- **Solution**: Hardcoded the backend URL in API configuration for consistency
